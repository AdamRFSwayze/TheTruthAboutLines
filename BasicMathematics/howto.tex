\chapter{How to Use This Book}

This book is an attempt to take a course such as Algebra I and treat it no differently from higher mathematical topics.  The authors feel that there is a trend in treating these lower-level concepts in a procedural fashion in stark contrast to the concept-heavy courses that mathematics majors typically encounter later in their education.  The focus here is not on exercises, but on problems in order to keep students engaged by challenging them with concepts rather than recipes.

\begin{exercise}
$2 + 9 = $
\end{exercise}

\begin{problem}
How do we add two numbers together?
\end{problem}

\begin{defn}[Solution]
A solution is any value or set of values which, when substituted for variables, makes the equation true.  A solution to an equation with multiple variables will have a value for each variable.
\end{defn}

\begin{recall}
What is the commutative property of addition?
\end{recall}

\begin{prblm}
What's something that's in the intersection of the set of flowers and the set of things that are red?
What would the intersection of the solution sets of two linear equations be like?
\end{prblm}
