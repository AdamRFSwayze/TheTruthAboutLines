\chapter{Operations}

Numbers come in a lot of different forms. We all know that 2 is a number. Many of us have seen $\pi$ in some capacity and recognize that it is a number. In a similar manner, you may know that $\sqrt{9001}$ and $3i + 17$ are numbers. But without understanding what these numbers mean, they are worthless. The first step in our journey towards establishing meaning for numbers starts with classification of these numbers.

\begin{boxdefn}[Number Set]
	A number set is a collection of numbers.
\end{boxdefn}

First definition down. This is a small, but significant definition as well. Number sets will be a recurring character throughout this book. 

\begin{boxdefn}[Natural Number]
	A number is called natural if we can use it to count. We denote the set of natural numbers as $\mathbb{N}$. \\ $1,2,3,4,$ and $5$ are examples natural numbers.
\end{boxdefn}

We use natural numbers every single day. However, there are some quantities that we cannot describe using natural numbers. Enter the integers.

\begin{boxdefn}[Integer]
	A number is an integer if it has no fractional part. An integer can be either positive or negative. We denote the set of integers as $\mathbb{Z}$. \\$-4, -2, 0, 3,17,  9002$ are all examples of integers. 
\end{boxdefn}


Definition overload.
