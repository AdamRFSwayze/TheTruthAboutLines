\chapter{Solving Linear Equations}

Since we were young, we've been solving more basic equations for variables, but we just didn't know it at the time.

\begin{example}
Simplify.

$$2*3 = x$$

The only operation left to perform on the left-hand side is multiplication.

$$6 = x$$

Because equality is symmetric, we can flip the left and right sides.

$$x = 6$$
\end{example}

Of course, we normally don't have so many steps when we need to find $2*3$, but this idea has held every time you've seen a blank spot in an equation.  Any time the problem has something to simplify
